  <p>'This disregard for motive is echoed throughout literature that argues against the phrase, along with the dry fact that terrorist groups are groups which do not possess statehood. We can then recognise the two pillars of the argument against the cliche as these: that motives don’t matter, and that official statehood is a determinant factor.'

<h2>Kitchen Sync Realism</h2>
<p>
Written as a part of the zine for <a id="link" href="https://aplacethatfostersus.tumblr.com/">A Place That Fosters Us</a>. (2019)
</p>
<p>
  ...we've fallen out of these synchronicities into another, wholly different one. There is no more stoking the fire, waiting for a home to heat up before leaving on vacation for fear of bursting pipes, no heating the furnace as a precursor to a functional kitchen. Automation and the instantaneity of digital processes have all but erased the metronome of daily life. Now, these synchronicities are purely fabricated coincidences.

    <p>June and July see the celebrations of Pride around the globe, and in London, this culminates in the iconic Pride Parade on the 7th of July. Amidst the rainbow paraphernalia, exuberant performances, and unabashedly targeted merchandise appropriated by marketing departments across the nation, there lies a rich history of the struggles and triumphs that painted the lives of the LGBTQ+ community.

    <p>The bid to make Aberdeen more culturally engaging is a practical move by tourism boards to relieve some of Edinburgh’s tourist congestion. By redirecting the streams of visitors further north, there’s hope that individuals will discover the cultural offerings of Scotland as not simply isolated to the capital. In this vein, Aberdeen is making a name for itself as a cultural staple for championing street and contemporary art, design, jazz and more.

    <p>
Following the 2016 USA presidential election results, there has been no shortage of literature attempting to make sense of the strange new political playground of our times. Everything from well-researched books to personal blogs to the astoundingly ill-informed quips on Facebook and Youtube comment sections were giving their two cents. The topic has been bled dry, and yet here we are still bringing it up, a testament to the importance of this networked space of politics and its pervasiveness that will certainly not yield in the foreseeable future.

In this world where products are so far removed from their origins, HOWL is a breath of fresh, organic air. She designs, cuts, sews everything herself, and her ideologies on sustainability and gender norms clearly shine through in her work. The connection from designer to end product to consumer is irrefutable. Even the fabrics and raw materials used are considered in a transparent way.

  <p>
The occult is warned against, and this makes it all the more attractive. It creates cracks in the concrete wall built up by the Enlightenment and leaks in serenely disruptive discourse. The history of the occult runs parallel to women being depicted as witches to women embracing their magic and witchery as a symbol of power and agency, for individuals to rise against the hegemonic powers of patriarchy and the narrow scope of scientific positivism, from subjugation to subversion.

International Workers’ Day: Art and Labour</h2>

<p>
While we love the alcohol-infused apolitical parts of May Day celebrations as much as the next person, the premise of labour and socialist thought is something that shouldn’t be overlooked. Art often gets categorised as an autonomous sphere of existence outside of capital, but art, like all culture, is a product of its environment. Yet art has the tendency to be critical of its environment, exposing the absurdity and violence that the system in authority espouses.

  "It's a far cry from what was once another gritty, sparse neighbourhood in the Southeast of Berlin. People say that Neukölln has trouble shaking its reputation, but the rampant gentrification pummeling through Berlin doesn't leave much untouched. And after an enlightening tour of old Neukölln courtesy of Eat the World, it's easy to understand why Neuköllners wouldn’t want to leave their now vibrant neighborhood."

<p>
  "The 2018 Berlin Biennale, now in its 10th edition, takes the city as a starting point and pits it in conversation with the world. Reading its curatorial statement, this melting away of cultural identity into the monotonous folds of economy remains front and centre. The key word here is “postcolonial”, a term that is neatly avoided by the statement but that reverberates in every room of the participating venues."

<p>
  "By the end of the panel, everyone was on the edge of their seat and sweating from the heat and tension of the exchanges made. This was not least due to keynote speaker Farzana Khan of Platform London and Voices That Shake. Her impassioned speech about the subjugation of brown and black bodies, the violence done to marginalised peoples, and the sovereignty of whiteness in public and art spaces which underpins the business models that abound might’ve been uncomfortable but was necessary to hear for the largely white audiences and panel members."

<p>
  "In Search of Dinozord is a performance about current conflict that comes together in its ability to produce an energy can only be for those still living. The Coffin Jump, on the other hand, perhaps plays into the double entendre of its name well in that it is a mausoleum, to enshrine the important acts of yesteryear. It finds its perfect setting in the green pastures of the Yorkshire Sculpture Park, scenic and peaceful, the ideal place to find rest."

The site-specific installation incorporates existing works including a 3D avatar of the artist questioning the current productivity and efficiency of culture, and digitally altered versions of JMW Turner’s 1840 painting, The Slave Ship."

The biometric appointment that each visitor is subjected to exemplifies this. “Bio”, the compoundable form that means “life”, is still navigated by faceless governing entities, without the emotionality and romance that the dead is given. The living goes on living without ceremony."

But when that inevitable lukewarm dreariness of bad weather hits, we take it as a sign to skip town and find amazing art elsewhere. In doing so, our list of exhibitions to see continues to grow."

  "Charrière gives audiences a unique view of the impact of thermonuclear weapons testing on the Pacific Ocean. Focusing on Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands 70 years after the underwater atomic explosions were carried out by the U.S. military, the exhibition features two video installations highlighting underwater recordings of the aftermath as well as coconut sculptures covered in metal to mimic round missile shells."
